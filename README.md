# HTML Practice 

This repository contains a collection of practices conducted during the learning of HTML, covering various concepts and structures of the language. Each practice was developed to test and enhance the understanding of HTML, semantic elements, links, lists, images, text formatting, and web page navigation.

5. **Practice 5: Text Formatting**
    - Demonstration of text formatting using tags like `<b>`, `<em>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`.

6. **Practice 6: Images and Links**

7. **Practice 7: Simple Table
- Creation of a simple table with country data, divided by continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, America).

8. **Practice 8: Styled Table
